💻 Project Title: Guess the Number Game

Domain: Java Programming
Level: Beginner

🧠 Project Description:

The Guess the Number game is a simple Java console-based application where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The program gives hints to guide the player — such as whether the guessed number is too high or too low compared to the correct number.
This project demonstrates basic Java programming concepts like:

Conditional statements (if-else)

Loops (while, for)

Random number generation (java.util.Random)

User input handling (Scanner)

Logical problem-solving and user interaction

⚙️ Key Features:

The system randomly generates a number within a specific range (e.g., 1 to 100).

The user is prompted to guess the number.

The program gives hints:

“Too high” if the guess is greater than the number.

“Too low” if the guess is smaller.

The game continues until the user guesses correctly or reaches the maximum number of attempts.

Option to play again after finishing one round.

Displays the total number of attempts used.

🧩 Sample Output:
Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!
I have selected a number between 1 and 100.
Can you guess it?

Enter your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 62
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.
Do you want to play again? (yes/no)
